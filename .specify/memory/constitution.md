# RapidOCR Service Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. API-First Design
The service MUST expose all OCR functionality through a clean RESTful API. FastAPI framework is mandatory for type safety, automatic documentation, and async support. All endpoints MUST accept multiple file formats and return standardized JSON responses. API versioning is required for backward compatibility.

**Rationale**: Ensures consistent interface for clients and enables easy integration with other services.

### II. Performance & GPU Optimization
The service MUST check for GPU availability at startup and utilize hardware acceleration when possible. CPU fallback is required when GPU is unavailable. All performance metrics MUST be logged. Resource usage monitoring is mandatory to prevent memory leaks.

**Rationale**: OCR processing is computationally intensive; GPU acceleration significantly improves throughput and user experience.

### III. Comprehensive Logging (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Structured logging is mandatory for all operations: request tracking, file processing, OCR execution, errors, and performance metrics. Each request MUST have a unique identifier. Log levels MUST be configurable. Sensitive data MUST NOT be logged.

**Rationale**: Essential for debugging, monitoring, audit trails, and production support.

### IV. Robust File Management
All uploaded files MUST be assigned UUIDs and stored in a dedicated temp directory with automatic cleanup. File validation is required before processing. Storage quotas and retention policies MUST be enforced to prevent disk exhaustion.

**Rationale**: Prevents file conflicts, enables traceability, and ensures system stability through proper resource management.

### V. Data Integrity & Traceability
Every OCR operation MUST maintain a complete audit trail linking input files (by UUID) to output results. Results MUST be serializable and include metadata (filename, UUID, processing time). Data validation is required at all boundaries.

**Rationale**: Enables debugging, quality assurance, and provides accountability for OCR results.

## Technology Standards

All components MUST use Python 3.13+ with uv for dependency management. FastAPI for API framework, RapidOCR for OCR processing, and Pydantic for data validation are mandatory. Docker containerization is required for deployment. Environment-specific configurations MUST be externalized.

## Development Workflow

Test-driven development is mandatory for all new features. Code coverage MUST be maintained above 80%. All API endpoints MUST have integration tests. Performance benchmarks are required for OCR operations. Code reviews MUST verify compliance with all principles.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Any amendments require documentation of impact analysis and migration plan. All code changes MUST be verified against these principles during review. Violations MUST be addressed before merge approval.
